## Introduction

clone-me is an innovative, open-source initiative that enables individuals to create "digital clones" of their knowledge and expertise. By structuring personal experiences, skills, and problem-solving approaches into shareable repositories, clone-me aims to democratize expertise and foster global knowledge exchange.

There's nothing better than letting AI and custom instructions guide our AIs to make everything flow more easily. By integrating artificial intelligence and custom instructions into our process, we can optimize the interaction between humans and machines, facilitating more efficient and personalized knowledge transfer.

### Key Features
- Open-source framework for personal knowledge management
- Community-driven development and improvement
- Decentralized knowledge storage
- Cross-disciplinary learning and collaboration

## Using with CursorAI

For users of the CursorAI code editor, you can easily integrate this clone-me repository as a submodule. This allows CursorAI to access and utilize the knowledge base directly within your coding environment.

To set up:

1. In your project directory, run:
   ```
   git submodule add git@github.com:udecode/dotai.git .clone-me
   ```
2. This will create a `.clone-me` folder with the contents of this repository.
3. CursorAI can now access and use the information in this folder to assist you in your coding tasks.

For more detailed instructions and use cases, see the [CursorAI Integration Guide](./use-cases/dot-clone-me-cursor-ai.md).
